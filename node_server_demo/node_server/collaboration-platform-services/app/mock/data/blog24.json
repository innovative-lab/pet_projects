Following them will increase development productivity. This blog and its contents might seem fundamental and basic to most Java developers, nevertheless these topics need to be discussed and documented till it is known and followed by all developers.</p>\n\n<h2>Workspace Management</h2>\n\n<p>Eclipse workspaces are something to which most of us don’t give a second thought. But if you don’t understand what is involved in a workspace, it can lead to a lot of confusion later. So a workspace is just a folder right? Yes but there’s more to it than that. All workspaces contain a “.metadata” folder. It contains all the preferences and settings used by this workspace. Also many eclipse plugins store their information here as well. So making any changes to this folder is a very bad idea. If you want to make a copy of the workspace settings for another workspace, copying this folder is not the solution.</p>\n\n<h3>Tip 1: Importing Projects</h3>\n\n<p>While creating multiple workspaces, most of us have the tendency to maintain multiple copies of projects. One point to note here is that the project does not need to exist in the workspace. While importing projects to the workspace, make sure to unpick “Copy projects into workspace” option. Maintain all projects in a single location and just import them into workspaces without copying them. By following this only one copy of the project is maintained reducing further confusions.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://vista-mindtree.cloudapp.net/coe_open/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/img1.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5148\" src=\"https://vista-mindtree.cloudapp.net/coe_open/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/img1.png\" alt=\"img1\" width=\"643\" height=\"707\" /></a></p>\n\n<h3>Tip 2: Selecting workspaces on startup</h3>\n\n<p>When working with multiple workspaces, we can ask eclipse to prompt for the selection of workspace at every startup. We do this by accessing Windows->Preferences->General->Startup and Shutdown->Workspaces. Here we tick the “Prompt for workspace on startup” box. We can also specify how many workspaces to display, and which workspaces to display.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://vista-mindtree.cloudapp.net/coe_open/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/img2.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5149\" src=\"https://vista-mindtree.cloudapp.net/coe_open/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/img2.png\" alt=\"img2\" width=\"735\" height=\"604\" /></a></p>\n\n<h3> </h3>\n\n<h3>Tip 3: Ignoring resources on commit</h3>\n\n<p>When using the Team synchronization feature of eclipse to commit the code to tools like SVN,Git etc, we do not want to commit the eclipse related files. These files include the “.classpath”, “.settings”, ”.project” files and folders. We can exclude these files from any commit operations. We do this by accessing Window->Preferences->Team->Ignored Resources. Here we can add any pattern which we don’t want to be included in a commit by clicking on “Add Pattern”.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://vista-mindtree.cloudapp.net/coe_open/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/img3.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5151\" src=\"https://vista-mindtree.cloudapp.net/coe_open/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/img3.png\" alt=\"img3\" width=\"776\" height=\"738\" /></a></p>\n\n<h3>Tip 4: Using Working Sets</h3>\n\n<p>We normally find ourselves in a situation where there are far too many projects in our workspace. This clutters up our workspace and makes it harder to find files. Here is an messy example. This is still somewhat manageable, but imagine 100+ projects to work with.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://vista-mindtree.cloudapp.net/coe_open/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/img4.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5152\" src=\"https://vista-mindtree.cloudapp.net/coe_open/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/img4.png\" alt=\"img4\" width=\"465\" height=\"356\" /></a> Working sets can help us here. Working sets are a way to logically group the items in our workspace. To create a working set follow these steps, Click on ‘Select Working Set’ <a href=\"https://vista-mindtree.cloudapp.net/coe_open/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/img5.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5153\" src=\"https://vista-mindtree.cloudapp.net/coe_open/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/img5.png\" alt=\"img5\" width=\"630\" height=\"360\" /></a> Click on ‘New’ to create a new working set. <a href=\"https://vista-mindtree.cloudapp.net/coe_open/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/img6.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5155\" src=\"https://vista-mindtree.cloudapp.net/coe_open/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/img6.png\" alt=\"img6\" width=\"388\" height=\"446\" /></a> Select ‘Resource’ and click next. <a href=\"https://vista-mindtree.cloudapp.net/coe_open/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/img7.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5156\" src=\"https://vista-mindtree.cloudapp.net/coe_open/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/img7.png\" alt=\"img7\" width=\"526\" height=\"423\" /></a> Enter a name for the set, select the required items from the workspace and click finish to create the working set. <a href=\"https://vista-mindtree.cloudapp.net/coe_open/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/img8.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5157\" src=\"https://vista-mindtree.cloudapp.net/coe_open/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/img8.png\" alt=\"img8\" width=\"526\" height=\"500\" /></a> You can select the working set in the ‘Select Working Set’ menu and only those items will show up in your explorer window.</p>\n\n<h3>Tip 5: Using Run Configurations</h3>\n\n<p>Run configurations are very useful if you need to perform the same operation several times. A few examples are,</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Build a project</li>\n<li>Run an application</li>\n<li>Run Unit tests To create a Run configuration, </li>\n</ul>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Select Run-> Run Configurations.</li>\n<li>Right click on a configuration type (eg: Maven Build) and select new.</li>\n<li>Enter a suitable name for the configuration.</li>\n<li>Select the appropriate project from the workspace by using ‘Browse Workspace’.</li>\n<li>Enter the goals.</li>\n<li>You can choose to optionally skip test case execution.</li>\n<li>Select number of threads for this configuration.</li>\n<li>Click Apply to save the configuration. Find an example run configuration below. It performs a ‘clean install’ of a maven project. Additionally it also uses the ‘cobertura:cobertura’ goal to run a code coverage analysis. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://vista-mindtree.cloudapp.net/coe_open/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/img91.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5160\" src=\"https://vista-mindtree.cloudapp.net/coe_open/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/img91.png\" alt=\"img9\" width=\"800\" height=\"644\" /></a> To run the configuration, select it from the handy icon in the workspace.</p>\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://vista-mindtree.cloudapp.net/coe_open/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/img10.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5161\" src=\"https://vista-mindtree.cloudapp.net/coe_open/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/img10.png\" alt=\"img10\" width=\"435\" height=\"342\" /></a></h3>\n\n<h3>Tip 6: Run a maven webapp with an embedded tomcat</h3>\n\n<p>Maven provides us with the ability to run a webapp in an embedded tomcat. Follow the below steps, Add the following lines in your pom.xml file of the maven project you wish to run.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://vista-mindtree.cloudapp.net/coe_open/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/img11.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5162\" src=\"https://vista-mindtree.cloudapp.net/coe_open/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/img11.png\" alt=\"img11\" width=\"387\" height=\"108\" /></a> Create the following run configuration. Notice the goal used is ‘tomcat7:run’ <a href=\"https://vista-mindtree.cloudapp.net/coe_open/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/img12.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5163\" src=\"https://vista-mindtree.cloudapp.net/coe_open/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/img12.png\" alt=\"img12\" width=\"802\" height=\"640\" /></a>   Please let me know about any other interesting tips which you might know about in the comments.  </p>\n",
