Lets examine the above sentence more closely.\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Blockchain is a <code>public ledger</code>. Transactions in the blockchain network are grouped in blocks which are linked together as a chain. Hence the name blockchain. The ledger is public as every node has the same copy and can access any transaction of any account.</li>\r\n \t<li>Blockchain network is <code>permissionless</code>. The nodes of the blockchain network do not have to obtain permission or authenticate themselves to be part of the network. Anyone in the world would be able to join the network and function as a full node. This is true for public blockchain networks such as bitcoin, but not so for private ones.</li>\r\n \t<li>Blockchain network is a <code>peer to peer distributed</code> network. All the nodes in the network are completely equal, perform the same set of operations and maintain the same copy of the ledger.</li>\r\n \t<li>Blockchain is maintained through <code>consensus</code> of the nodes. A block of transactions is only accepted into the blockchain when a majority of the nodes agree about its validity.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe term blockchain is often used interchangeably to describe both the blockchain network (network of nodes) and the ledger (chain of blocks).\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\nTo fully understand blockchain, we still need to know about 2 more concepts\r\n<h3>Mining</h3>\r\nWhen new transactions are created in the network, all the nodes know about them. The nodes continuously try to find the next block in the blockchain. Whichever node is successful in doing so is rewarded (Bitcoin in case of bitcoin blockchain) This process of continuously trying to find the next block in the chain is referred to as <code>mining</code>. The nodes which participate in this process are called <code>miners</code>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://vista-mindtree.cloudapp.net/coe_open/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/1.png\" alt=\"Blockchain\" />\r\n<h3>Proof of work</h3>\r\nBut how do we decide which miner gets to add the next block in the chain? The miners actually play a game to decide this.\r\nIntrigued? Here's the game\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Â Each transaction has an id which is the hash of the transaction itself.</li>\r\n \t<li>The miner places these hashes as the leaf nodes of a merkle tree. Merkle trees are binary trees of hashes.</li>\r\n \t<li>The miner attempts to find the merkle root hash by recursively hashing together the contents of the leaf nodes</li>\r\n \t<li>This merkle root is placed in the next block's header along with a random nonce value and the header is hashed again to find the block id</li>\r\n \t<li>The final hash is checked to see if it's value is lower than the network decided value (difficulty)</li>\r\n \t<li>If the hash is lower, then the miner wins, adds to the chain and lets the network know about it's victory</li>\r\n \t<li>If not, then a new nonce value is chosen and the process is repeated</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBut how long will this process take? The answer is that it depends on the difficulty level. Bitcoin's current difficulty is set such that a block is created every 10 minutes\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://vista-mindtree.cloudapp.net/coe_open/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/2.png\" alt=\"Merkle Tree\" />\r\n<h2>What are the benefits of blockchain?</h2>\r\n<h3>Security</h3>\r\nThe transactions which are already part of the blockchain cannot be tampered or revised. If an attacker node wants to change the content of a block, it has to recalculate the block id with the tampered transaction.\r\nIt also needs to repeat this process for all following blocks in the chain. By this time, the network would have already formed more blocks in the chain.\r\nTo win this war, the attacker needs to control a majority of the nodes and obtain at least 51% of the computational power of the network to form a dishonest consensus.\r\nThis would turn out to be so expensive that even if the attacker wins, the net gain might be negative.\r\nThe highest security for the blockchain is that everyone knows how to defeat it, but no one can.\r\n<h3>Decentralized</h3>\r\nBlockchain is a distributed peer to peer network. This means that there is no single point of failure.\r\nAs long as a few nodes are alive, the blockchain is preserved.\r\n<h2>Genesis of blockchain</h2>\r\nBlockchain was the major technical innovation of bitcoin. It was created with the following in mind\r\n<h3>No central authority</h3>\r\nAs the entire network is peer to peer, there is no central authority who verifies transactions. This eliminates the trust factor in todays financial transactions and allows individuals to transact without paying high transaction fees. It also helps keep the transactions anonymous as the sender and receiver only reveal the hash of their public keys\r\n<h3>Single source of truth</h3>\r\nThe blockchain's public ledger acts as a single irrefutable source of truth.\r\nThis truth involves financial transactions in the case of bitcoin.\r\n<h2>Differences between Bitcoin and Blockchain</h2>\r\nA common misconception is that blockchain technology and bitcoin are inseparable. However Bitcoin is built on top of the blockchain. Blockchain technology can be used in a variety of usecases and bitcoin-like financial applications is just one such usecase. The transactions used in blockchain can represent any transferrable asset.\r\nBlockchain can be used in various scenarios\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>IoT</li>\r\n \t<li>Real Estate</li>\r\n \t<li>Digital Identity</li>\r\n \t<li>Gaming</li>\r\n \t<li>Record/Auditing</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Matrix comparison of open source platforms</h2>\r\n<table>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th>Parameters</th>\r\n<th>Ethereum</th>\r\n<th>Multichain</th>\r\n<th>Openchain</th>\r\n<th>IPFS</th>\r\n<th>Eris</th>\r\n<th>Factom</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td align=\"center\">License</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">GNU GPL, MIT, Affero License</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">GNU Affero GPL</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">Apache License</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">MIT License</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">GNU GPL</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">MIT License</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td align=\"center\">Latest Release</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">1.4.0 - beta</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">0.13.3 - alpha</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">0.5.1 - alpha</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">0.4.1 - alpha</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">0.11.4 - alpha</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">0.3.7 - alpha</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td align=\"center\">Architecture</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">Decentralized</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">Decentralized(*)</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">Centralized</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">Decentralized</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">Decentralized</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">Decentralized(*)</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td align=\"center\">Smart Contracts</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">Yes</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">No</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">No</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">No</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">Yes</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">No</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td align=\"center\">Distributed Data Storage</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">No</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">No</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">No</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">Yes</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">No</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">No</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td align=\"center\">Docker Implementation</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">Yes</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">No</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">Yes</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">Yes</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">Yes</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">Yes</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td align=\"center\">Wallet</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">Yes</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">Yes</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">Yes</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">No</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">No</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">Yes</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td align=\"center\">Mining</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">Yes</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">Yes</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">No</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">No</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">No</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">No</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td align=\"center\">Clients</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>java</li>\r\n \t<li>c++</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>java</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>javascript</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>javascript</li>\r\n \t<li>go</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>javascript</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>go</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td align=\"center\">Private/Public</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">Both</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">Both</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">Private</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">Public</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">Private</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">Private</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td align=\"center\">Documentation</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">Good</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">Average</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">Good</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">Good</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">Good</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">Bad</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td align=\"center\">Domains</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">Not specific</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">Trading and payments</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">Stocks, Music lisencing</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">Media hosting and sharing</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">Banking</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">Audit sys, Medical records, Property files</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2>Bibliography</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Satoshi Nakamoto. <em>Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System</em> https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf</li>\r\n \t<li>Bitcoin Blockchain Reference https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-guide#block-chain</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<hr />",
